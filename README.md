# dotfiles

My dotfiles here for the zsh shell, git and neovim (this one is not really in use since I use VSCode)

My dotfiles are stored in the `/.dotfiles` folder inside my machine. Then stowed (symlinked) to my home folder.  
This dotfiles [stow guide](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/managing-dotfiles) by Jake WieslerÔ∏è helped me while setting up my system. If you want to learn more about stow, you can read this guide as well as this [other guide](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#Terminology) from GNU project.

I use Oh My Zsh as my main zsh shell and the plugin is use are [zsh-autosuggetions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and [zsh-sintax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting). This are cloned to my `/.oh-my-zsh` folder using the [ansible playbook](https://github.com/43hershel/playbooks) during system setup.
